We should talk about coding style, project-specific idioms, and just generally how we do things here.

Code Format:
    - 4-space-width tabs, using spaces and not actual tabs.
    - Docstrings before every method and class, basically no exceptions.
    - Read PEP8 like it's your job, and take it very seriously.
    - Comments are good. Use them.
    - Wrap lines if they start getting to over 100+ lines.

Project Practices:
    - TDD is important, write tests. Docstring tests work too.
