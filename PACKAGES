This file lists the third-party modules, libraries, and packages
that we use for all reasons, and the version that we support.
It is here so that we don't ever run into problems of not being
on the same version of something, and to ease deployment.

The format is roughly based on PIP. Standard equivalency operators apply.

Backend:
    - Tornado==2.0
    - PyMongo==1.8.2

Frontend:
    - jQuery==1.6.2
